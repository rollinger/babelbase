# Content

Adds database translations as a templatetag to the frontend and the backend.

## How to use in Frontend

First the view has to be loaded with the ContentMixin and a list of namespaces. Note that the global namespaces set in
settings.DB_TRANSLATION_DEFAULT_IDENTIFIER are always prepended to the view_identifier_list and available the the View's
template.

While db translations are loaded on demand anywhere, using the ContentMixin on a view will prefetch all translations
of a given namespace and make them available to the template. T

```python
from kinderwunschpraxis_stuttgart_villa_haag.content_i18n.views import ContentMixin

class StartNewsfeedView( ..., ContentMixin):
    template_name = "news/index.html"
    view_identifier_list = ["newsfeed"]
```

Then in the template you can use one of the templatetags "get_content" or "blockcontent_i18n".
Three parameter are required:

- view_id or namespace
- key_id or identifier
- placeholder: the placeholder text that should appear (optional, but strongly recommended)

- The templatetags are builtins in settings.TEMPLATES and need not to be loaded separately.

```html
<p class="mb-4">
  {% blockcontent_i18n "newsletter" 'subscription_tagline' %} Get expert
  insights and timely updates on Private Markets developments with the Privatize
  Newsletter. {% endblockcontent_i18n %}
</p>

--or--

<p class="mb-4">
  {% get_content "start_index" "solutions_offer_privatize_title" "What Privatize
  offers to you and your clients" %}
</p>
```

## How to use in Backend

Prepare DB Translation for the script you want to use it after the imports, defining the namespaces to prefetch:

```python
from kinderwunschpraxis_stuttgart_villa_haag.content_i18n.translate import db_gettext_lazy as _db
from kinderwunschpraxis_stuttgart_villa_haag.content_i18n.translate import DatabaseTranslationBuffer

translation_namespace = ["user_tracks", "investor_qualification"]
db_buffer = DatabaseTranslationBuffer(translation_namespace)

# Then use it anywhere:
_db(db_buffer, "investor_qualification", "arbitrary_text", {"name": "Phil"})
```

IMPORTANT: Lazy loading is LOST once it is evaluated, so performing any operation on the returned **proxy** object will
break the on-demand translation functionality. E.g.:

```python
_db(db_buffer, "investor_qualification", "arbitrary_text", {"name": "Phil"}) + "another text"
```

would evaluate that composite string and translation would be lost.

## How to use in Management Commands

### manage_content_i18n_translations

RUN: python manage.py manage_content_i18n_translations

This management command iterates through all templates and get_or_creates the translations from the
templates. It also finds duplicates and stale translations.

This way, it's easy to update the translation state of an instance.

### update_content_i18n_fixture

RUN: python manage.py update_content_i18n_fixture

This management command updates the content_i18n fixture with the current state of the database.

### load_content_i18n_fixture

RUN: python manage.py load_content_i18n_fixture

This management command loads the content_i18n fixture into the database. Useful to apply translations to
production server
